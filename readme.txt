# zoom-backgrounds
CS4476: Computer Vision Project

The goal of this project is to allow users to easily remove certain objects from an image so that they can use the image as a Zoom background. 

On terminal, run "python select_object.py imageName.jpg intNeighborhoodSize intConstant"

The first pop-up image is the mask. 

In the second pop-up, select the item you want to remove.

In the third pop-up, select the background closest to the item.

The result is saved in the finalResults folder.
